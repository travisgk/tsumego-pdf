# tsumego-pdf
This tool generates a PDF of selected problems from any of the following tsumego selections collections:
  - *Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life &amp; Death: Elementary* (Solutions Available)
  - *Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life &amp; Death: Intermediate*
  - *Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life &amp; Death: Advanced*
  - *Goyko Shumyo*
  - *Xuanxuan Qijing*
  - *Igo Hatsuyo-ron*
<br>

![Tsumego](https://github.com/travisgk/tsumego-pdf/blob/main/example-outputs/outputs.png?raw=true)
The problems can be set to be flipped around randomly, as well as setting the color to play.<br>This program will also by default create a parallel PDF which will contain the answers to the selected problems (if solutions are available for the collection).

See the above output in full in the [the example PDF](https://github.com/travisgk/tsumego-pdf/blob/main/example-outputs/tsumego.pdf) and its corresponding [answers PDF](https://github.com/travisgk/tsumego-pdf/blob/main/example-outputs/tsumego-key.pdf).

### "Why wouldn't I just solve these Go puzzles on my computer?"
- The lack of instant feedback helps you improve visualization skills and simulates actual gameplay.
- It discourages finding answers by trial-and-error.
- Paper and a slower pace builds deep focus and can be a more relaxing experience.
- It provides you a healthy break from digital devices.
- Solving on paper reinforces the idea that you can solve problems on your own, boosting your self-reliance in the game.

## Setup
You will need Pillow and ReportLab to run this program.
`pip install pillow reportlab`

<br>

## Usage
The following code selects 100 random problems from *Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life &amp; Death: Elementary* and 100 random problems from *Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life &amp; Death: Intermediate*, mixes them all together, and then saves a PDF with invisible labels and another PDF with the problems labelled and solutions provided.

This provides [a PDF with the tsumego](https://github.com/travisgk/tsumego-pdf/blob/main/example-outputs/random-200-mix.pdf) and [a companion PDF with the solutions](https://github.com/travisgk/tsumego-pdf/blob/main/example-outputs/random-200-mix-key.pdf).

```
import random
import reportlab.lib.pagesizes
import tsumego_pdf

problem_selections = []

# adds 100 random problems from Cho's Elementary Life & Death.
collection_name = "cho-elementary"
problem_nums = random.sample(range(1, 901), 100)
problem_selections.extend([(num, "cho-elementary") for num in problem_nums])

# adds 100 random problems from Cho's Intermediate Life & Death.
collection_name = "cho-intermediate"
problem_nums = random.sample(range(1, 861), 100)
problem_selections.extend([(num, "cho-intermediate") for num in problem_nums])

# shuffles all the selections.
random.shuffle(problem_selections)

tsumego_pdf.create_pdf(
    problem_selections,
    page_size,
    problems_out_path="random-200-mix.pdf",
    solutions_out_path="random-200-mix-key.pdf",
    color_to_play="black",
    landscape=False,
    num_columns=2,
    column_spacing_in=3,
    spacing_below_in=1,
    placement_method="block",
    include_text=True,
    problem_text_rgb=(255, 255, 255),
    solution_text_rgb=(128, 128, 128),
    include_page_num=True,
    display_width=12,
    verbose=True,  # shows progress bar
)
```

Setting `problem_nums` to `None` will select all problems in the desired collection.

## Notes
Problems **#218** and **#533** in the Elementary section of Cho Chikun's problems have been pointed out as unsolvable, so they've been tweaked for this repository. Problem *#344* in the Intermediate section has been tweaked as well.
